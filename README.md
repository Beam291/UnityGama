# Unity VR Gama

Nowadays, computer models are heavily used for decision-making and consultation, and to help to analyze and predict the outcome of the decision in the present and the future. The usage of interactive simulations is quickly gaining ground as a means of enabling improved appropriation of the simulation results. Even if the majority of modeling systems in use today allow users to interact with simulations these interactions remain simple, whereas there are now new approaches that go further in terms of immersion. One of them is Virtual reality, also known as VR, which is a term used to describe a computer-simulated environment that can give the impression of physical presence in the place of the real or imagined world. In fact, new opportunities for simulation interaction have arisen as a result of the recent democratization of virtual reality headsets. My work focuses on the coupling between VR and computer simulation and was applied to the CityScope Bac Hung Hai model. This model, which is based on an agent-based model developed with the GAMA platform, allows to simulate the Bac Hung Hai irrigation system and studies several issues including increasing demand, pollution, under-investment, depletion of resources, or environmental change.
